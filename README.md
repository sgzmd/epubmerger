# Mini-design document

## What and how we'll be doing here

  * Step 1: open all epub files, and move all the resources to the new file. Each resource is assigned new id/href - we must maintain the link between old id/href and the new one (unclear by which one should we key this though).

  * Step 2: re-generate cover page based on new resource names

  * Step 3: re-generate TOC

  * Step 4: update all internal references (optional)
