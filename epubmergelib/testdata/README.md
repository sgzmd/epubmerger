# About these files

The `sample?.epub` files in this directory are artificially created _small_ samples which are guaranteed to
pass epub validation using [epubcheck](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck).

The files were created using [Sigil](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil).

`chekov.epub` was downloaded as an example of real-life epub book (public domain).
