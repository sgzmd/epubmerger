EpubMerge: Android App
======================

The goal of this app is to allow the user to merge multiple epub files directly on their Android device, without resorting to any cloud service / desktop computer.

## High-level use-cases

The usage of the app as follows:

  1. TU opens the app
  2. TU adds epub files in the app's main screen, one-by-one or selecting several in one go
  3. TU rearranges the files so they go in the right order
  4. TU specifies the title for the new book (edits suggested title)
  5. TU specifies the author for the new book (edits suggested author)
  6. TU specifies some additional fields of the metadata
  7. New file is being built and stored to the user-specified directory.

## MVP definition

For the initial version, the app will allow to:

  * Select `.epub` files, one by one or multiple, whatever easier
  * Rearrange them
  * Compile merged epub file

Anything beyond that is for v1+.
